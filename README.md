# Comparing Four DQN Variants from the Field of Deep RL on Atari Breakout

This repository contains the project report for my final year project, 'Comparing Four DQN Variants from the Field of Deep Reinforcement Learning on Atari Breakout'

The DQN variants compared as part of this project were the:
- Double DQN
- Dueling DQN
- Dueling DQN with PER
- Mellow DQN
